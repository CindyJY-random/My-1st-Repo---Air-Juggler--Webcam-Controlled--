# My 1st Repo : Air Juggler (Webcam Controlled) 
Trying out my first ever project (finally after years of procrastination) 
    This project is a learning experiment using **TensorFlow.js** and webcam-based
    gesture detection.

    ## Credits :<
    This project is inspired by and reimplemented based on:

    - Goku-kun, *Air Juggler using TensorFlow.js*  
    https://github.com/Goku-kun/air-juggler-using-tensorflowjs

    The original project is licensed under the MIT License.

    ## Notes
    This repository was created as a learning and practice project based on a
    practice site from CodedeX. I am following the tutorial to understand how webcam-based 
    games can be built using TensorFlow.js after going through the course of "Machine Learning with
    Python" from freeCodeCamp which also itroduces TensorFlow as a platform and software library for 
    Machine Learning (ML).
